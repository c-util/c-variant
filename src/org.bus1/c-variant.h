/**
 * Error Codes
 *
 * We usually return negative 'errno'-style error codes from all functions, in
 * case they can fail. All of them must be treated as programming errors or
 * fatal runtime exceptions. There is usually no reason why any of those errors
 * can occur at runtime, if suitable validation of input is done beforehand.
 * However, such validation is not always assumed necessary, hence, it is
 * perfectly valid to rely on the error codes.
 *
 * EBADMSG: Caller-provided GVariant serialization is invalid.
 * EBADRQC: Specified type does not match type of variant.
 * EFBIG: Scatter-gather array larger than the address space.
 * ELOOP: Nesting level of the GVariant type is higher than supported.
 * EMEDIUMTYPE: Invalid GVariant type/container specified.
 * EMSGSIZE: Message is larger than supported by this architecture. Very
 *           unlikely to happen, as you'd need type strings of large lengths.
 * ENOBUFS: Too many iovecs.
 * ENOMEM: Cannot allocate required backing memory.
 * ENOTUNIQ: Attempt to modify the NULL GVariant.
 */

/**
 * NULL GVariant
 *
 * The entire GVariant API accepts NULL as valid GVariant. Whenever it is
 * passed, it is treated as the unit type (type signature is "()"). However, we
 * cannot store any state in a NULL pointer, therefore, any attempt to modify
 * the internal state of the GVariant (including 'enter', 'exit', ...) will be
 * rejected with ENOTUNIQ. Any queries that do *not* alter the internal state
 * will be served as if you queried the unit type.
 */

/**
 * C_VARIANT_MAX_LEVEL - maximum container depth
 *
 * The GVariant specification is highly recursive and allows infinitive depths.
 * However, for security reasons, applications should limit the depth of types
 * they receive from untrusted sources. Otherwise, parsing complexity might
 * increase significantly. Hence, this implementation has a hard-coded, but
 * arbitrary, maximum nesting depth. The limit is chosen in a way that all
 * operations can be performed in reasonable times with any depth within the
 * supported range.
 * This limit defines the maximum nesting level (eg., '0' means only the root
 * level is supported, as such effectively only allowing basic types, '1' means
 * one container level is allowed, and so on..).
 *
 * Note that any type you send and/or receive should be hard-coded. You should
 * never build types dynamically. Hence, this limit should in no way affect the
 * runtime of your application (even if you deal with higher nesting depths
 * than this). You *must* verify types before parsing them.
 *
 * Note that this limit only applies to true type signatures. It does not apply
 * to nested variants (that is, real nesting via 'v' elements).
 */

/**
 * C_VARIANT_MAX_SIGNATURE - maximum length of a signature
 *
 * GVariant types can be nested and concatenated arbitrarily. However, to
 * simplify the implementation, we enforce an arbitrary limit in the maximum
 * length of a type signature. As types are static, this limit should be
 * impossible to hit, but if you do, it's trivial to increase.
 *
 * Note that this limit only applies to true type signatures. It does not apply
 * to nested variants (that is, real nesting via 'v' elements).

#define C_VARIANT_MAX_SIGNATURE (65535)

/**
 * C_VARIANT_MAX_VARG - maximum depth of vargs
 *
 * Several accessor functions use variable length argument lists to allow easy
 * access to read/write nested types. To process such requests, the
 * implementation must store state for each nesting level. To avoid runtime
 * overhead, there is a static limit on the maximum depth allowed in a single
 * function call. If you need higher depths, you are required to explicitly
 * enter/exit the containers.
 *
 * Exceeding this limit will result in a fatal exception, as it prevents us
 * from producing predictable behavior. Therefore, you better not pass deeply
 * nested types to dynamic accessor functions (it will become an unreadable
 * function call, anyway).
